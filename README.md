## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learned more about utilizing background-image positioning for unique designs where the designer intended for an image to start off-screen
- I gained a deeper understanding of how to think responsively

### Continued development

I need to practice more with designs where the responsivness can be tricky in order to get faster and more efficient.
